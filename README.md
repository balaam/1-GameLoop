#1-GameLoop

A simple GameLoop using OpenGL and SDL

##Building for windows

I downloaded mingw, navigated to /etc and renamed fstab.sample to fstab. The downloaded a 32bit version of sdl. Ran make on the root of the SDL code, checked the examples by entering /tests and running ./configure, make. Then it should be possible to build.
